#chuck-norries-joke-generator
This project is a fun little app that pulls Chuck Norris jokes via an API 
and reflects them based on either category or search query.

Lessons learned throughout this project:
- implementing an API call via JSON
- getting search terms from the URL to use in API call
- pagination using a "Load More" button
